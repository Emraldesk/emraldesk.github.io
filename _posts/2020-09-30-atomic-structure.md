## CRT Experiment
In this experiment a glass tube was filled with a very low-pressured gas and its ends were cathode and anode, when sufficiently high volatages were applied, it was observed that the phosphorecent coating at the anode-end of glass tubelit up. The behaviour of cathode ray particles resembled those of negatively charged particles called electrones.

### Thomson Model
J.J. Thomson proposed plum-pudding model of atom. 


## Gold Foil Experiment
In this experiment alpha-particles were bombarded at a very thin sheet of gold foil. Most of the particles directly flew through the gold foil, some where deflected by a small angle and very few completely bounced back.
